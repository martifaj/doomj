# doomj
DOOM engine clone **under development** written in Java.

I used as reference StanislavPetrovV's DOOM level viewer (https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/DOOM-Level-Viewer), the DOOM engine black book (https://fabiensanglard.net/gebbdoom/) and the original DOOM source code (https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM).
Also, I have made extensive use of AI tool such as Gemini pro 2.5 and Claude Code.
